            <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
            <p  class="two-p">Hello! My name is Sam Kacprowicz. I'm currently studying Computer Systems Engineering at Arizona State Universisty.
                I'm a senior, and expect to graduate in May of 2023.
            </p>
		
		<p class="two-p">
		Some of my most recent projects at ASU include programming an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d4VRpJ7G-U"><em>autonomous vehicle</em></a> to navigate via sonar and color sensing, a <a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/9c1HYCOKaRk"><em>catalytic converter alarm system</em></a> capable of real time user notifications via the <em>Twilio API</em>, a <em>blockchain</em>-based chain of custody program for keeping track of evidence in digital forensics cases, and an implementation of a messaging app that uses both peer-to-peer and client-server models.
		</p>
		
            <p class="two-p">
            I gained experience in <em>debugging</em> code and <em>paired programming</em> at Scottsdale Community College, where I worked as a <em>computer science tutor</em> and peer mentor.
            Teaching students to break problems down into smaller and more approachable ones, and explaining topics like recursion and different
             types of data structures were my favorite things to demonstrate.
            </p>
            <p class="two-p">
            Over the Summer of 2021 I developed a <em>JUnit based testing suite</em> for Scottsdale Community College's Computer Science Department. 
            We were able to bring the coursework for their "Object Oriented Programming and Data Structures" class online, by writing instructions 
            for assignments on Replit.com, and developing a series of JUnit tests that would examine the effectiveness of the students' projects.
            </p>
            <p class="two-p">
            Some of my other favorite memories from Scottsdale Community College include building an electronic door lock for a final project
            in an assembly language class. It was my first exposure to <em>embedded programming</em>, and after a long time of operating machines, it 
            was nice to finally be able to say that I could build them. I'd be remiss if I didn't mention building a pneumatic water balloon cannon
            for a physics class, as it was also one of my favorite projects, although there wasn't anything computer science related to it.
            </p>

		In my spare time I enjoy welding, cycling, rock climbing, and playing tennis with friends.
